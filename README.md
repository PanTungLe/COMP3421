COMP3421 Mid Project:

The URL as the submission of this assignment is as of the following: http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~18079633d.

Following the URL, my personal website which is set up within the department’s Intranet platform can be thereon reached. 

Layout and design outline:

The website uses five fonts in total: Oswald, Raleway, Roboto, Roboto Slab, and Source Sans Pro, all of them licenced under the Apache License, Version 2.0, an open source software licence which gives permissions to users to use and distribute the software freely and under any purpose.

The colour scheme of the website includes an array of hues, but the palette in general inclines towards cooler colours: black (#000000), white (#ffffff), two different shades of gray (#99aab5, #2c2f33), alabaster (#f9f9f9), gold (#ffd700)

The website is written with HTML and internal CSS, meaning the CSS style is allocated at the beginning of the document using <style>.

The title of the website is “Tung-Le Pan Homepage”. At the top of the homepage is a navigation box with four links to potential subpages of the website, one of which opens a dropdown list when hovered over. Every link in the navigation box changes colour when hovered over, altering both that of the text and the background. 

Following it is what is commonly called as a “hero image”, a large image with an appropriate amount of opacity spanning the entire width of the website serving as the background, covered with text in limited quantities. This is where my name is introduced for the first of many times on the homepage (when disregarding the one in the title.) 

After that, the page is divided into horizontally: on the left is a profile picture of me being cropped into a circle, with a few icons underneath as links leading to methods which one would be able to contact me. These icons are originally .svg files and I used the “filter” property to fit the colour scheme of this homepage (or more precisely, #99aab5).

On the right is a short introduction of myself, with selected text being highlighted with gold and/or linking to relevant websites. The links remain undecorated with the exception of some underlining underneath to denote the text as hyperlinked. 

At the end of the introduction of myself, I listed some places and countries which I have been to, presented in the form of a table, with borders only in the header and at the bottom of it, with rounded edges. The header also shares a different background as the rest of the table, following the colour (#99aab5) of the aforementioned icons and that of the footer which immediately follows the table and concludes the homepage, which contains the second link on the homepage linking to a subsection of the page, the first being the “About Me” box on the navigation row.
